# RemNote Zen Version

Being a huge fan of the note taking app RemNote, I decided to create a mini zen version within a couple of days just for myself, I used tip tap as the core editor and built on top of it to give a try [RemnoteZEN](https://remnote.site) to visit the server side code [RemnoteZENServer](https://github.com/rtpa25/remnote-server)
